## What OEE Is

The **Open Execution Engine (OEE)** is an open-source monorepo that provides domain-specific implementations of the [Sigil Open Framework](https://github.com/Sigil-Core/sigil-open-framework) enforcement architecture.

OEE is organized into **verticals** — pre-configured enforcement stacks for specific deployment domains. Each vertical inherits shared enforcement primitives from `/core/` and adds domain-tuned policy templates, integration examples, and documentation.

The first vertical is **OVE (Open Venture Engine)** — a fully autonomous venture capital stack secured by deterministic Intent Attestation enforcement.

---

## Enforcement Architecture

Every OEE vertical uses the same enforcement layer:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│     AI Agent (Brain)    │
│  ElizaOS / AgentKit /   │
│  LangChain / Custom     │
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ Intent
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      Sigil Sign         │  ← Deterministic execution firewall
│  Sigil Lex evaluates    │
│  ASSURANCE.md policy    │
└────────────┬────────────┘
             │ Intent Attestation (Ed25519 JWT)
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Execution Engine      │
│  AgentKit / ERC-4337    │
│  RPC / Bundler Gateway  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

The Brain proposes. Sigil authorizes. The Engine executes — only after attestation.

No transaction may execute on-chain without a valid Intent Attestation.

# Getting Started

OEE is a monorepo. Choose your path:

### Deploy a vertical (recommended for most users)

Verticals are pre-configured OEE implementations for specific domains. Start with the vertical closest to your use case.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sigil-Core/oee.git

# Venture capital / fund deployment (Open Venture Engine)
cd oee/verticals/venture

# Follow the vertical's README for setup instructions
```

**Available verticals:** [→ Browse verticals](./verticals/)

### Build on OEE core (for framework contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sigil-Core/oee.git
cd oee/core
# See core/README.md
```

### Contribute a new vertical

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the vertical contribution guide.
